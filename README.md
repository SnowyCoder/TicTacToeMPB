## Tic Tac Toe Multiplayer (in Bash)
This is a version of TicTacToe written purely in bash based on multiplayer

### Start
To start you must choose who will be the server and who will be the client (in the game it doesn't make any difference)
<br> The Server will type `./trismp server <port>` where port is the port where the game will be hosted
<br> The Client will type `./trismp client <ip> <port>` where ip and port are the ones of the server
<br> After that the game will start

### Input
The only input is the cell to tick, to select the right cell follow this table:
<br> 123
<br> 456
<br> 789
<br> The cells are numbered from 1 to 9 starting from top-left and ending at bottom-right.
